# Notes

- React is a library
- JSX is html like syntax we write inside JS
- JSX to go back to js mode we use {}
- JSX converts back to React.createElement() calls
- compile? transpile
- JSX (Babel) vs SWC (Rust)
- What's JSX? A file extension.
- We can't return 2 things from a function
- For this we can use React.Fragment <></>
- Props is how we pass and recieve data in our components
- The value of props is an object
- We use Object Destructuring when working with props {}
- Component makes our code reusable
